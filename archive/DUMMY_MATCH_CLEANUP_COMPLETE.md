## 🔧 Enhanced SportMonks Fetcher Features

### 🚫 Strict Team Validation
```python
# REJECTS dummy/placeholder names:
dummy_patterns = [
    'home team', 'away team', 'team a', 'team b', 
    'unknown team', 'test team', 'mock team', 'demo team',
    'placeholder', 'tbd', 'to be determined'
]
```

### ✅ Validation Rules
1. **Team name required**: No empty or missing names
2. **Minimum length**: Names must be at least 3 characters
3. **No number-only names**: Rejects "123" or "456"
4. **SportMonks ID required**: Every team must have valid API ID
5. **Dummy pattern detection**: Automatically rejects test/placeholder names

### 📝 Comprehensive Logging
- **Valid fixtures**: ✅ Logged with team names and SportMonks IDs
- **Skipped fixtures**: 🚫 Logged to `skipped_fixtures_missing_teams.json`
- **Detailed reasons**: Each rejection includes specific reason
- **Statistics tracking**: Complete counts and success rates

### 🛡️ Fixture Rejection Examples
```bash
INFO:fixtures.fetch_sportmonks:✅ Valid team created/found: Brighton and Hove Albion (SportMonks ID: 31)
INFO:fixtures.fetch_sportmonks:✅ Valid team created/found: Liverpool (SportMonks ID: 14)
INFO:fixtures.fetch_sportmonks:✅ Valid fixture processed: Brighton and Hove Albion vs Liverpool (ID: 123)

ERROR:fixtures.fetch_sportmonks:🚫 REJECTED dummy team name: 'Home Team 1'
ERROR:fixtures.fetch_sportmonks:🚫 SKIPPED - Invalid teams for fixture 999 - REJECTING FIXTURE
```
