## üéØ Supported Betting Markets

‚úÖ **Fulltime Result (1X2)** - Match Winner: Home/Draw/Away  
‚úÖ **Over/Under 2.5 Goals** - Total Goals Over/Under 2.5  
‚úÖ **Both Teams To Score (BTTS)** - Yes/No  
‚úÖ **Asian Handicap** - Line betting  
‚úÖ **Correct Score** - Exact final score  
‚úÖ **Double Chance** - 1X/X2/12 combinations  

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **SportMonks API Account** with odds data access
2. **API Token** with sufficient quota
3. **Python Dependencies**: pandas, requests, python-dotenv
4. **Training Dataset** (your existing Premier League CSV file)

## üîß Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create/update your `.env` file:
```bash
SPORTMONKS_TOKEN=your_sportmonks_api_token_here
# OR
SPORTMONKS_API_TOKEN=your_sportmonks_api_token_here
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas requests python-dotenv
```

## üöÄ Workflow

### Step 1: Test API Connection

Before running the full collection, test your API setup:

```bash
python test_sportmonks_odds.py
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Verify API token and connection
- üîç Discover available markets and bookmakers  
- üé≤ Test odds extraction on sample fixtures
- üí∞ Check API quota and estimate costs

### Step 2: Collect Historical Odds

Run the main odds collection:

```bash
python sportmonks_odds_collector.py
```

**Interactive Options:**
- Choose number of fixtures to process (start small for testing)
- Automatic discovery of available markets/bookmakers
- Progressive logging and error handling

## üìä Expected Results

### Data Enhancement

**Before:** 22 columns per fixture
```
fixture_id, home_team, away_team, date, home_goals, away_goals, etc.
```

**After:** 40+ columns per fixture
```
Original columns + odds features:
- 1x2_home_odds, 1x2_draw_odds, 1x2_away_odds
- 1x2_market_margin, 1x2_market_efficiency

## üí∞ API Cost Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Conservative 1.5 second delay between requests
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Rate limit detection and handling

### Quota Management
- 1 API call per fixture for odds data
- ~1,520 fixtures = ~1,520 API calls
- Estimated time: ~40 minutes for full dataset

### Cost Optimization
- Start with small samples (10-50 fixtures)
- Test market availability before full collection
- Priority bookmaker selection reduces redundant data

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. No odds data found**
```
- Check API subscription includes odds data
- Verify SportMonks v3 API access  
- Test with recent fixtures first (better coverage)
```

**2. Rate limiting errors**
```
- Increase rate_limit_delay in collector
- Check API quota status
- Consider spreading collection over multiple days
```

**3. Missing target markets**
```
- Run test_sportmonks_odds.py to discover available markets
- Update market IDs in sportmonks_odds_collector.py
- Some markets may not be available for older seasons
```

**4. Bookmaker not found**
```
- Check available bookmakers with test script
- Update priority_bookmakers list
- Some bookmakers may have limited historical data
```

### Debug Steps

1. **Test API Connection**
   ```bash
   python test_sportmonks_odds.py
   ```

2. **Check Sample Fixture**
   ```bash
   # Manually test a fixture ID
   curl "https://api.sportmonks.com/v3/football/fixtures/YOUR_FIXTURE_ID?include=odds&api_token=YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

3. **Start Small**
   ```bash
   # Test with 5-10 fixtures first
   python sportmonks_odds_collector.py
   # Enter: 10
   ```

## üìà Expected Performance

### Coverage by Season
- **2023/24:** 90-95% fixtures with odds
- **2022/23:** 85-95% fixtures with odds  
- **2021/22:** 80-90% fixtures with odds
- **2020/21:** 75-85% fixtures with odds
- **2019/20:** 60-80% fixtures with odds
- **2018/19:** 50-70% fixtures with odds
- **2017/18:** 40-60% fixtures with odds
- **Older seasons:** 20-50% fixtures with odds

### Market Availability
- **1X2:** Highest availability (~95% where odds exist)
- **Over/Under 2.5:** Very high (~90% where odds exist)
- **BTTS:** High (~85% where odds exist)
- **Asian Handicap:** Medium (~60% where odds exist)
- **Double Chance:** Medium (~70% where odds exist)  
- **Correct Score:** Lower (~40% where odds exist)

## üéØ Integration with ML Pipeline

### Feature Selection
```python
# Core odds features for model training
odds_features = [
    '1x2_home_odds', '1x2_draw_odds', '1x2_away_odds',
    '1x2_market_margin', '1x2_market_efficiency',
    'over_under_25_over_odds', 'over_under_25_under_odds', 
    'btts_yes_odds', 'btts_no_odds',
    'has_odds'
]
```

### Handling Missing Values
```python
# Features are NaN where odds not available
# Use has_odds flag to filter or impute
df_with_odds = df[df['has_odds'] == True]

# Or fill missing odds features
df['1x2_home_odds'].fillna(df['1x2_home_odds'].median(), inplace=True)
```

### Market Efficiency Indicators
```python
# Use market margins as features
# Lower margin = more efficient market = better signal
efficient_markets = df[df['1x2_market_margin'] < 0.05]  # <5% margin
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

After successful odds integration:

1. **Feature Engineering:** Create derived features from odds
2. **Model Enhancement:** Include odds features in training
3. **Backtesting:** Validate model performance with historical odds
4. **Live Integration:** Use OddsAPI for future predictions

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the log files for detailed error messages
2. Run the test script to diagnose API issues
3. Review SportMonks API documentation
4. Verify your subscription includes historical odds data
