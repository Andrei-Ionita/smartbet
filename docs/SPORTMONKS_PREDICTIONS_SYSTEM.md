# SportMonks Predictions System - Complete Overview

## üéØ What We Achieved

We successfully implemented a sophisticated prediction system that leverages the **SportMonks Predictions Addon** to identify high-confidence betting opportunities from the target European leagues.

---

## üìä Core Discovery: Multiple AI Models

### Key Finding
SportMonks uses **3 or more AI models** per fixture to generate predictions. Each model provides independent 1X2 probabilities (Home Win, Draw, Away Win).

### Our Innovation
Instead of blindly trusting a single model, we built an **intelligent ensemble analysis system** that:
1. Validates all available models
2. Analyzes consensus and variance
3. Selects the optimal prediction strategy
4. Calculates true confidence levels

---

## üß† Multi-Model Analysis Algorithm

### Validation Phase
```typescript
// Step 1: Validate each prediction model
for (const prediction of fixture.predictions) {
  if (prediction.predictions.home > 0 &&
      prediction.predictions.draw > 0 &&
      prediction.predictions.away > 0) {
    
    // Validate probabilities sum to reasonable range (90-110%)
    const total = home + draw + away
    if (total >= 90 && total <= 110) {
      validPredictions.push(prediction)
    }
  }
}
```

### Analysis Metrics
We calculate four critical metrics:

#### 1. **Ensemble Average**
```typescript
homeAvg = Œ£(model.home) / modelCount
drawAvg = Œ£(model.draw) / modelCount
awayAvg = Œ£(model.away) / modelCount
```

#### 2. **Consensus Score**
```typescript
// How many models agree on the same outcome?
consensus = modelsAgreeingOnBestOutcome / totalModels
```

#### 3. **Variance Analysis**
```typescript
// How spread out are the predictions?
homeVariance = Œ£((model.home - homeAvg)¬≤) / modelCount
drawVariance = Œ£((model.draw - drawAvg)¬≤) / modelCount
awayVariance = Œ£((model.away - awayAvg)¬≤) / modelCount
avgVariance = (homeVariance + drawVariance + awayVariance) / 3
```

#### 4. **Highest Confidence Model**
```typescript
bestPrediction = model with max(home, draw, away)
```

## üé≤ Strategy Selection Logic

Our system intelligently selects between three strategies:

### Strategy 1: Ensemble Average (Most Reliable)
**Conditions:**
- Consensus > 60%
- Variance < 50

**Why:** When models strongly agree with low variance, averaging them produces the most accurate prediction.

```typescript
if (consensus > 0.6 && avgVariance < 50) {
  strategy = 'ensemble_average'
  return { home: homeAvg, draw: drawAvg, away: awayAvg }
}
```

### Strategy 2: Highest Confidence with Consensus
**Conditions:**
- Model count ‚â• 3
- Consensus < 60% OR variance ‚â• 50

**Why:** Multiple models exist but disagree; trust the most confident one.

```typescript
else if (modelCount >= 3) {
  strategy = 'highest_confidence_with_consensus'
  return bestPrediction
}
```

### Strategy 3: Highest Confidence (Default)
**Conditions:**
- Fewer than 3 models

**Why:** Limited data; use the single most confident prediction.

```typescript
else {
  strategy = 'highest_confidence'
  return bestPrediction
}
```

---

## üéØ Confidence Calculation

### Final Confidence Score
```typescript
confidence = max(finalPrediction.home, finalPrediction.draw, finalPrediction.away)
```

### Minimum Confidence Threshold
```typescript
MINIMUM_CONFIDENCE = 55%
```

**Rationale:** Only recommend matches where the probability exceeds 55%, ensuring positive expected value over time.

---

## üìà Ranking & Scoring System

### Score Formula
```typescript
score = bestProbability + evContribution

where:
evContribution = ev > 0 ? min(ev, 0.20) : 0
ev = (probability √ó odds) - 1
```

### Why This Works
1. **Primary Factor:** Highest probability (confidence)
2. **Bonus Factor:** Expected value (capped at 20% to prevent odds manipulation)
3. **Result:** Matches ranked by true betting value

## üìä Example Analysis

### Scenario: 3 Models Predicting a Match

**Model 1:**
- Home: 65%, Draw: 20%, Away: 15%

**Model 2:**
- Home: 62%, Draw: 23%, Away: 15%

**Model 3:**
- Home: 68%, Draw: 18%, Away: 14%

### Analysis Results:
```typescript
ensemble_average: { home: 65%, draw: 20.3%, away: 14.7% }
consensus: 100% (all models predict Home)
variance: 6.2 (very low)
strategy: 'ensemble_average'

FINAL PREDICTION:
  Outcome: Home Win
  Confidence: 65%
  Strategy: Ensemble Average
  Explanation: "3 models strongly agree with low variance"
```
