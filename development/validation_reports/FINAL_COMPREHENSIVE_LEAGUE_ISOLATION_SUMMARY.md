def validate_league_usage(self, league_name: str = None):
    """Enforce league-specific usage to prevent contamination"""
    if league_name not in self.authorized_leagues:
        raise ValueError("🚨 CROSS-LEAGUE VIOLATION")
```

### Safety Enforcement Flags
```python
self.authorized_league = "Premier League"  # or Serie A, La Liga
self.enforce_league_safety = True
```

### Error Prevention Examples
```
🚨 CROSS-LEAGUE VIOLATION: This Premier League model cannot predict Serie A matches!
🚨 CROSS-LEAGUE VIOLATION: This Serie A model cannot predict La Liga matches!  
🚨 CROSS-LEAGUE VIOLATION: This La Liga model cannot predict Premier League matches!
