| 3 | `prob_ratio_home_draw` | 8,642.94 | 505.06 | Home vs Draw probability ratio |
| 4 | `log_odds_home_draw` | 8,555.35 | 302.87 | Log odds difference |
| 5 | `log_odds_draw_away` | 7,818.46 | 233.32 | Log odds difference |
| 6 | `bookmaker_margin` | 5,945.77 | 622.55 | Market margin analysis |
| 7 | `market_efficiency` | 4,885.52 | 278.11 | Market efficiency measure |
| 8 | `uncertainty_index` | 3,276.36 | 708.44 | Probability uncertainty |
| 9 | `odds_draw` | 2,902.82 | 249.23 | Draw odds value |
| 10 | `goals_for_away` | 2,665.45 | 363.05 | Team performance stat |
| 11 | `recent_form_home` | 2,535.50 | 1,448.53 | Recent home form |
| 12 | `recent_form_away` | 2,515.45 | 1,055.07 | Recent away form |

### 🔍 Serie A vs Premier League Feature Analysis

**Key Differences**:
- **Form features** more important in Serie A (`recent_form_home`, `recent_form_away`)
- **Uncertainty and margin** features highly valued in Serie A
- **Pure odds features** relatively less important than in Premier League
- **Team performance** (`goals_for_away`) moderately important

**Interpretation**: Serie A model relies more on team form and market uncertainty, suggesting different tactical patterns compared to Premier League.

## 🔮 PREDICTION INTERFACE FEATURES

### Production-Ready Capabilities

```python
class SerieA1X2Predictor:
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.confidence_threshold = 0.60  # 60% confidence minimum
        
    def predict_match(self, home_odds, away_odds, draw_odds, home_team, away_team):
        # Returns complete prediction with confidence analysis
```

### Example Usage

```python
predictor = SerieA1X2Predictor()
result = predictor.predict_match(2.10, 3.40, 3.20, "Juventus", "AC Milan")

# Output:
# Prediction: Draw
# Confidence: 35.2%
