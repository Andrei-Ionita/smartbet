## 🎲 Betting Strategy Recommendations

### **✅ RECOMMENDED BETS**
- **Away Wins**: 61.9% precision - Strong betting signal
- **Home Wins**: Use with caution - Moderate signal (53.5% precision)

### **❌ AVOID**
- **Draws**: Model cannot predict draws reliably (0% precision)

### **💰 Risk Management**
- Maximum bet: 5% of bankroll per prediction
- Only bet when model confidence > 60%
- Stop if 7-day performance drops below 40%
- Start with paper trading for 2-4 weeks

## 📞 Usage Instructions

### **Quick Start**
```python
# 1. Load the feature pipeline
from feature_pipeline import build_feature_set

# 2. Process your match data
ml_features = build_feature_set(your_raw_data)

# 3. Load the trained model
import joblib
model = joblib.load('production_lightgbm_20250628_131120.txt')

# 4. Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(ml_features)
```

### **For New Data**
1. Ensure your data has: `date`, `home_team`, `away_team`, odds columns
2. Run through `feature_pipeline.py` to create clean features
3. Use trained models for predictions
4. Apply risk management rules before betting
